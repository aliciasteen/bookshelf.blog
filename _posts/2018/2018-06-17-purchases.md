# Ruthless Rhymes by Harry Graham 
![](/images/blog/ruthless-rhymes-harry-graham.jpg)

This is a third copy but the others are much earlier (both RR and more RR). This is such a lovely copy to receive as a gift. And for those that don't know Ruthless Rhymes - well look into them.  I first learned many of them 30 years ago and never met anyone else who knew them. Then one day on holiday in Switzerland with an international group of friends I recited one of the poems ( possible 'when baby's cries grew hard to bear'.   An American friend looked shocked as he had only every heard it from his Grandfather in Montana when he was a boy, always thought they were his Grandfather's poems and was astounded that someone else knew them.

# The Secret Barrister 
![](/images/blog/the-secret-barrister.jpg)

Bought the Secret Barrister myself from the Big Green Bookshop in London. Learnt today from the Sunday Times that it has been in the top 10 for 24 weeks.   Almost finished it.  Confirms something that I have argued for years namely that the UK criminal justice system is broken, that its primary aim is not truth (that isn't a criticism) and that criminal lawyers are undervalued.   We might not think that the criminal law affects us but of course that view will only last until it does.  It will when you are a victim of crime, a witness to crime or accused, whether rightly or wrongly of a crime.  The Secret Barrister's treatment of the difference between the UK adversarial system and other countries inquisitorial system is particularly good. I find myself agreeing with what he or she says but not the conclusion on that part.  An excellent book and highly recommended.

# What Happened

This hardback copy of 'What Happened' was bought  yesterday so not read yet. It is the is the UK first edition first print. Always good to have. Having read some reviews of this book and also an extract I was looking forward to getting it.   On a related subject I read this week of the enormous growth in populism versus what I might call pragmatic politics. I think the estimate in the article I read was that populism had reached 35% of the vote so hopefully Mrs Clinton's book will shed some light on this.

# Update 14th September 2018 - two more

Firstly a new Booker winner - already put on this site in the Booker Prize winners section. It is the UK hardback of Lincoln in the Bardo which for about 1 month more is the reigning Booker Prize champion as it were.

The other is this:

The Republic of Thieves by Scott Lynch is the third book in the Gentleman Bastard series. Apparently it took 6 years to write.  This is the UK hardback first edition first impression  - so has a complete number line.

The first book in the series was 'The Lies of Locke Lamora' and the second 'Red seas under red skies'.  The story of how a publishing director at Orion in the UK found 'lies' on Scott's blog and bought the rights has been told many times.   Well done Simon!

My copy of The Lies of Locke Lamora is rather special as it is one of only 15 'lettered copies' and is signed by Scott.  It was published by Subterranean Press in 2017. Its rarity is why it is covered in Brodart film.

The Red Skies is a BCA hardback version and half size - not a good copy at all.
